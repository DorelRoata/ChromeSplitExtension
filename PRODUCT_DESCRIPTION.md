# Split View for Chrome

## Store Listing Description

- Dual, quad, and custom pane counts.
- Drag-resizable split grid.
- Per-pane controls:
  - Back
  - Reload
  - URL/search bar
  - Close + compact horizontally
  - Close + compact vertically
- Save named layouts and reload them from a saved list.
- Reset splitter sizes for active split tabs.
- Dark mode and nav bar visibility toggle.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
